This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Background
According to statistics found on the United States Elections Project website, run by Dr. Michael McDonald of the University of Florida, approximately 51.8% of Nebraskans eligible to vote in 2018 showed up to a polling place and cast a ballot, putting Nebraska 24th out of all fifty states and Washington, D.C. in this measure. With this in mind, it is our belief that a driving factor in developing a free and intuitive source of information through which voters in Douglas County, Nebraska can easily obtain relevant information about their voting districts and elected representatives. 

With this in mind, we built a website which would allow any citizen in Douglas County, NE to enter his or her address and obtain this relevant information. This will include, first and foremost, a listing of elected officials that represent them with hyperlinks to campaign financial disclosure information, as available online. It includes a geographical representation (using the Google Maps API, or equivalent) of their precinct/district boundaries for various local and statewide elections along with a historical listing of election results for the aforementioned district or precinct, where those results are available online. 

Much of the data used as resources in this project will be obtained from existing sources, such as the 2018 Nebraska General Election Data and the Douglas County Election Commission results page. With these valid sources in mind, the goal of the project is to present information relevant to voters in a modern and intuitive manner.

## Usage

When the page loads, enter the first line of an address into the form, along with a selected election type, in order to get the election district and map boundaries for that location. Displays placeholder data as a substitute for future data integrations.
